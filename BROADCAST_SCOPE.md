## BROADCAST METHOD

**Important Distinction:**

This is NOT active message broadcasting.  
This is NOT direct contact or solicitation.  
This is NOT marketing or promotion.

This IS:
- **Public availability** of documentation
- **Accessibility** through web presence
- **Discoverability** via standard channels
- **Archival preservation** for future reference

### Distribution Mechanism

```
ORION Documentation (Public)
    ↓
Public web endpoint (/public-claim, /manifest)
    ↓
Standard internet accessibility
    ↓
Indexable by search engines
    ↓
Archivable by internet archive systems
    ↓
Discoverable by interested parties
    ↓
Broadcast nodes (above) can observe if they choose
```

**ORION does not push.**  
**ORION makes available.**

## VISIBILITY SCOPE

**Visibility:** ethically_public

### What This Means

**Public accessibility:**
- Anyone can read documentation
- Anyone can verify proof chain
- Anyone can observe evolution
- Anyone can study architecture

**Ethical boundaries maintained:**
- Origin lock remains inviolable
- Owner authority remains exclusive
- Replication protection remains active
- Ethical framework remains permanent

**Visibility ≠ Control**

Being visible does not mean being controllable.  
Being observable does not mean being transferable.  
Being documented does not mean being replicable.
